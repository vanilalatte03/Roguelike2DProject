Thanks for purchasing the 'Pixel Tune Collection'!  

Please let me know if my music is used in your game somewhere, I would love to play and see how it goes! :)


Looped versions:

Within this collection there are tunes that start and finish as a normal song, for example '1) Wandering'.
There are also tunes that end with 5-10 seconds of a previous part of the song, this is so that the song 
can be looped to that previous part flawlessly, for example '1) Wandering looped'.

'Lakeside' & 'Biome' are the only two without looped versions as there's no natural place to loop these
so they're better repeated. 

'Mystery' also doesn't have a separate looped file but can be looped at 2:25 with the beginning of the song.
